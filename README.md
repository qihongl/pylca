# The leaky, competing, accumulator (LCA)

this is a lightweight python implementation of the leaky, competing, accumulator, based on [1], [2] and [3]. The default is to behave like [2]. I need a really fast LCA in python for research purposes but I couldn't find it, so I wrote one. And I thought I'd shared it just in case other people need this.

#### how to use

here's an 
<a href="https://github.com/qihongl/pylca/tree/master/example">example</a> 
that you can play with on google colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/qihongl/pylca/blob/master/example/demo_lca.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab" title="Open and Execute in Google Colaboratory"></a>

#### install 

its on 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pylca/">PyPI</a>, 
so simply do `pip install pylca`


#### note 

this implementation... 
- ... allows any non-negative self-excitation. [1, 2] assume self-excitation of the accumulators is zero. 
- ... doesn't terminate the LCA process when the (activity threshold) criterion is met, which is different from [2]. the user can truncate the activity time course post-hoc 
- ... lower bound the output activity by 0 (i.e. ReLU), like [1, 2]. [3] doesn't do this. 
- ... doesn't perform exponential weighted moving average of the inputs. [3] can do this. 
- ... is linear, which is what [2] does. [3] supports non-linear transformations of the output.
