# The leaky, competing, accumulator (LCA)

this is a lightweight python implementation of the leaky, competing, accumulator, based on [1], [2] and [3]. 
<br>

#### how to use

here's an 
<a href="https://github.com/qihongl/pylca/tree/master/example">example</a> 
that you can play with on google colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/qihongl/pylca/blob/master/example/demo_lca.ipynb"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab" title="Open and Execute in Google Colaboratory"></a>

the script will generate the follwing plot, showing that more units got activated -> more competition -> reduce the activity level of the strongest unit == increase uncertainty. this is a desired property emerged from the competition across all accumulators.

the effect of leak is straightforward: controlling for everything else, accumulators with bigger leak get less activated

#### install 

its on 
<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pylca/">PyPI</a>, 
so simply do `pip install pylca`


#### note 

this implementation... 
- ... allows any non-negative self-excitation. [2] assumes the strength of self-excitation (for the accumulators) is zero. 
- ... doesn't terminate the LCA process when the (activity threshold) criterion is met, which is different from [2]. the user can truncate the activity time course post-hoc. 
- ... lower bound the output activity by 0 (i.e. ReLU), like [1, 2]. [3] can do other non-linear transformations
- ... doesn't perform exponential weighted moving average of the inputs. [3] can do this.
